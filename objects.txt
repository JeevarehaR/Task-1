A Blog About Objects and Its Internal Representation:

1)Objects:
	The Object class represents one of JavaScript's data types.
	It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. 
	Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
	objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” 
	“A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.
	For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.
	The following code assigns a simple value (Jeeva) to a variable named Candidate: var candidate = "Jeeva";
	Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
	The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:
 	var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”, Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
	The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon;)
	Syntax: var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
	So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.

2)Object Properties:
	The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
	The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.
	Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
	The syntax for adding a property to an object is : ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
	The syntax for deleting a property from an object is: delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
	The syntax to access a property from an object is: objectName.property //Car.Make  or objectName["property”]// Car["Make"] or objectName[expression] //x="Make";Car[x]
	So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.

3)Object Methods:
	An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
        Java Script Object Methods are "actions that can be performed on objects”.
        Here is the list of object methods:
            *Shallow copy — Object.assign()
 	    *Deep copy — JSON.parse() & JSON.stringify()
 	    *Object.create()
 	    *Object.entries()
 	    *Object.keys()
 	    *Object.values()
 	    *Object.freeze()
